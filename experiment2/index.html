                    <p>This project offers a generative, living impression of this inspiring image:</p>
                    <div class="image-wrapper">
                        <img src="experiment2\img\farmlandscape.jpg">

                    <p>Relation to inspring image:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Color: The sky, grass/hill, tree, treeline, and sunset colors were sampled from the inspiring image using a color picker webiste which takes the colors codes of a given image.</li>
                        <li>Primitives: The trees are rendered with triangle primitives.</li>
                        <li>Polygons: The hills and treeline were made using vertex calls</li>
						<li>Ellipses: The clouds were made using layered ellipses of varying colors.</li>
                        <li>Composition: Different random seed values lead to different shapes of the hills and treeline and different postions of the clouds and trees.</li>
						<li>Life: The postion of the clouds is animated to simulate natural cloud movement in response to the horizontal motion of the mouse.</li>
                    </ul>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This experiment helped me better understand javascript. I now have a clear grasp of the screen as making ther vertices of the different terrain forced me to figure out the x and y coordinates of the generative image. Overall I had fun recreating the image and seeing its generative aspect with the random() function at use.</p>
